# Project Governance Policy

*This document provides the minimum governance policy for Projects in the OpenEducationAnalytics Organization (the "Organization"). Individual Projects can either use this policy or set up their own governance policy in accordance with the [Organization's Governance](./ORG-GOVERNANCE.md).*

The Project Maintainers agree to this policy and to abide by all of the Organization's polices, including
[Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md),
[Trademark Policy](./trademarks.md), and
[Antitrust Policy](./antitrust-policy.md).

## 1.	Roles.

The Project may include the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted and documented by the Project.

**1.1.	Maintainers**. "Maintainers" are responsible for organizing activities around developing, maintaining, and updating the Project. Maintainers are also responsible for determining consensus. The Project will designate one or more Maintainer. The Project may add or remove Maintainers with the approval of the current Maintainers (absent the maintainer being removed) or oversight of the Organization's Steering Committee ("SC").

**1.2.	Contributors**. "Contributors" are those that have made Contributions to the Project.

## 2.	Decisions.

**2.1.	Consensus-Based Decision Making**. The Project makes decisions through consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Maintainers will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Contributors and nature of support and objections. The Maintainers will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements.

**2.2.	Appeal Process**. Decisions may be appealed by opening an issue and that appeal will be considered by the Maintainers in good faith, who will respond in writing within a reasonable time. If the Maintainers deny the appeal, the appeal may be brought before the SC, who will also respond in writing in a reasonable time.

## 3.	How We Work.

**3.1.	Openness**. Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue financial barriers to participation.

**3.2.	Balance.**  The development process should have a balance of interests. Contributors from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective of achieving balance.

**3.3.	Coordination and Harmonization.** Good faith efforts shall be made to resolve potential conflicts or incompatibility between releases in the Project.

**3.4.	Consideration of Views and Objections.** Prompt consideration shall be given to the written views and objections of all Contributors.

**3.5.	Written procedures.** This governance document and other materials documenting the Project's development process shall be available to any interested person.

## 4. No Confidentiality.

Information disclosed in connection with any Project activity, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.

## 5. Trademarks.

Any names, trademarks, logos, or goodwill arising out of the Project, however owned, may be only used in accordance with the Organization's [Trademark Policy](./trademarks.md). Maintainer's obligations under this section survive their affiliation with the Project.
