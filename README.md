# governance

The governance of OEA as an organization is modeled after the governance used by Fairlearn.org.
For project proposals, we follow the process used by The [Linux Foundation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) - that process can be found here: [proposing projects](https://github.com/lfai/proposing-projects)
